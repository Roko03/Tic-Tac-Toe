# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game in a 3x3 grid where you need to mark correct spaces to win. This project is based on a minimax algorithm. The Minimax algorithm is an algorithm that is mostly used in games such as chess, checkers, and tic-tac-toe. 

## Minimax algorithm

- Provides an optimal move for the player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally
- Use recursion to search through the game tree
- Used in games such as chess, checkers, and tic-tac-toe
